    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nihari is a deliciously smooth flour based stew with slow cooked mutton and a myriad of spices. This mutton nihari recipe takes ~4 hours to cook but it’s easy to put together. To get the best flavour, the mutton is cooked on very low heat for upto 4 hours.

        Traditionally Nihari was cooked all night and then served to the Mughal Kings of Delhi in breakfast after the morning prayers.

From the royal kitchens of the Mughals, the dish has now crossed all borders of region, religion, and course. However, since it takes a long time, almost 5 hour, to cook Nihari, it is mostly reserved for special occasions like Eid dinners and other festivities.

The first time I had nalli nihari was after my marriage when I was exploring the world of non-vegetarian cuisine. I was told it was one of the dishes that has converted many vegetarians. I loved the nihari stew and I could see how between Sikander and daddy the whole 1/2 kg mutton nihari was finished in just one meal. That meant I had to learn how to make nihari.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg  mutton , preferably shank portion (cut into 8-10 pieces)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp  Ghee/ Clarified butter</li>
        <li>2 medium onions , finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp  ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp  garlic paste</li>
        <li>Salt  to taste</li>
        <li>2 tsp  coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp  turmeric powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp  wheat flour</li>
        <li>3 tbsp  nihari masala</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat Ghee (you can use oil as well but ghee makes it tastier) in a deep bottom stock pot. Once the ghee is hot, add the sliced onions and fry till they start to turn brown.</li>
        <li>Add mutton pieces, ginger paste, garlic paste, coriander powder, turmeric powder and salt. Mix well to coat the mutton in ghee and spices. Sauté for 5 mins.</li>
        <li>Add the nihari masala and 8 cups of water. Mix well, cover and cook on very low heat for about 4 hours until the meat is tender. Keep checking in between. The way to know that the meat is cooked is when it breaks easily with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Dissolve wheat flour in half cup of water such that there are no lumps. Slowly add it to the gravy. Stir to mix it well in the gravy and let it simmer for another 10-15 mins till the gravy thickens.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some lime juice and garnish with ginger strips and fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
